          Hi! I'm Roy Eden, a Full-Stack Developer &amp; Electronic Arts Student
          who started coding in 2016 and hasn't stopped ever since! I've picked
          up some of the concepts of design and also about UX and accessibility
          over the years. This has also come with an interest in performance and
          also good DX.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that programming is and should always be a fun experience,
          that's why I like sharing it with other people. For example: helping
          others start on their programmer journeys. It's always a joy to
          collaborate with others, see how others code and how others think.
          This is also the reason I love open source projects and try to
          contribute to them whenever possible. I also love to reverse engineer
          solutions or modify some code to experiment with what others make.
        </p>
