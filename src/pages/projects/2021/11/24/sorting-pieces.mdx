  ### About
  [This demo](http://demo-sort-pieces.vercel.app/) showcases a simple game of [a
  library I made to handle sorting different items in a game with different
  levels](https://github.com/royeden/sorting-pieces-game). It was made in 2 days for a university project.

This site is made with:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org).
- [React](https://reactjs.org).
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/).
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/).
- [Vercel (Hosting)](https://vercel.com/).
- [Rollup (for the library bundling)](https://vercel.com/).
