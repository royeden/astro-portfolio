  ### About
  [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)'s currriculum included a challenge to build a Simon game, this was my attempt at it at the time!

I believe most of the design was adapted from somebody else's at the time, but I don't remember who to give credit ðŸ˜¢.

The site is made with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org).
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/).

The website can be visited [here](https://react-simon.netlify.app/).

The source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/royeden/react-simon).
