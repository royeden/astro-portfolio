  ## About
  
  This website showcases an audiovisual project made during the 2020 worldwide pandemic.
  Every single audio clip, visual or image was made through a collaborative process online.

I was in charge of coding the site, organizing the posts and the build process, integrating external scripts and collaborating with the [design team](https://pandemi-ae.vercel.app/agradecimientos).

The site is made with:

- [Gastby](https://gatsbyjs.com).
- [React](https://reactjs.org).
- [Styled-Components (with emotion)](https://emotion.sh/).
- [GraphQL (API)](https://graphql.org/).
- [p5js (WEBGL animations)](https://p5js.org/).
- [Sanity (CMS)](https://sanity.io/).
- [Vercel (Hosting)](https://vercel.com/).
