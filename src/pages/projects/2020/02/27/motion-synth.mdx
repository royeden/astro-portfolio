### About

_(This project is currently being revisited)_

This project was born from testing a Proof Of Concept regarding the usage of TensorflowJS with React. It was inspired by the Theremin.

Using TensorflowJS's bodypix, it takes the keypoints of your body via the webcam and maps those values to a Synth frequency that's based on the notes of a Piano.

The site is made with:

- [React](https://reactjs.org).
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/).
- [TensorflowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/).
- [bodypix](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-segmentation).
- [Netlify (Hosting)](https://netlify.com/).
- Web Audio API.
- Web Canvas API.
